Project Overview and Objectives

This project aims to analyze retail transactional data to uncover profit-draining product categories, optimize inventory turnover, and identify seasonal sales patterns. The analysis provides actionable insights for improving profitability, inventory management, and strategic marketing efforts.
Tools Used
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization
•	SQLite for running SQL queries on the cleaned dataset
•	Tableau Desktop/Public or Power BI Desktop for creating interactive dashboards
•	Git and GitHub for version control and project sharing
•	Microsoft Word / Google Docs for report writing and documentation
How to Open and Run the Notebooks and Dashboard
1.	Python Notebooks:
•	Open the notebooks folder in VS Code or your preferred Jupyter environment.
•	Activate the Python virtual environment (venv) if applicable.
•	Run the notebooks sequentially:
•	data_cleaning.ipynb: Load and clean the dataset.
•	sql_analysis.ipynb: Perform SQL queries on the data.
•	correlation_analysis.ipynb: Conduct correlation analysis and generate visualizations.
•	visualizations.ipynb: Generate further visual summaries.
2.	Dashboard:
•	Open the Tableau dashboard file tableau_dashboard.twbx located in the project root.
•	Use the interactive filters for Region, Product Category, etc., to explore data trends.
•	Alternatively, if using Power BI, open the Retail_Analysis_Project.pbix file.
Summary of Deliverables
•	Cleaned Dataset: data/cleaned_data.csv
•	SQL Queries: Stored in sql_queries/ folder as .sql files
•	Jupyter Notebooks: In notebooks/ folder for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
•	Visualizations: Charts and heatmaps saved in visualizations/ folder
•	Dashboard: Interactive dashboard file tableau_dashboard.twbx (or Power BI .pbix file)
•	Project Report: Comprehensive project report saved as PDF in reports/retail_analysis_report.pdf
•	GitHub Repository: Source code and all project files version controlled and shared
